# An inventory manager for DnD fifth edition.
This tool is a .NET Core app that is extremely over engineered becuase I'm using it as practice for MVVM applications. UI is currently WPF but when I need to practice electron or some other front end framework I'll probably add that as well. Uses sqlite for database, and connects to the API available at https://www.dnd5eapi.co/ for item information. This app is being made becuase my DM wants us to track weight at a very granular level and I couldn't really find a tool that suited my needs and was free.
